# Scalable Healthcare Claims Data Pipeline with Analytics and LLM Augmentation

An end-to-end pipeline prototype simulating CMS/Medicaid data workflows — from raw claims ingestion through curated analytics layers to LLM-driven insight generation.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a production-style data pipeline for healthcare claims analysis, modeled after the kinds of workflows used in CMS Medicaid programs (T-MSIS, managed care reporting). It covers the full data lifecycle: ingestion, validation, transformation, SQL-based analytics, and LLM augmentation for automated insight generation.

The pipeline is implemented in Python and PySpark, with SQL analytics designed to be compatible with Databricks SQL, Snowflake, and BigQuery.

## Key Features

- **Scalable ETL design** — Python (pandas) for prototyping, PySpark for distributed scale
- **Data quality validation** — null checks, schema enforcement, row count validation, anomaly detection
- **SQL analytics layer** — cost analysis, utilization metrics, risk stratification, readmission proxy
- **LLM integration** — automated executive summaries, denial reason classification, natural language to SQL, anomaly explanation
- **Production patterns** — partitioned output, explicit schemas, auditability, reproducibility

## Notebooks (start here)

| Notebook | Layer | What it covers |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `notebooks/01_claims_etl.ipynb` | ETL | Ingestion, validation, transformation, curated output |
| `notebooks/02_sql_analytics.ipynb` | Analytics | Cost, utilization, risk, data quality queries |
| `notebooks/03_llm_automation.ipynb` | LLM | Executive summaries, denial classification, NL→SQL |
| `notebooks/04_visualizations.ipynb` | Visualization | EDA, cost drivers, risk segmentation, stakeholder charts |

## Scalability Considerations

The Python ETL pipeline (`notebooks/01`) is designed with the same logic structure as the PySpark version (`pyspark/claims_transformation.py`). This means:

- **Prototyping** happens in Python/pandas (fast iteration, no cluster needed)
- **Production scale** uses the PySpark version on a Databricks cluster or EMR
- Partitioned output by `state_code` allows downstream consumers to query only relevant partitions
- Explicit schema definitions (rather than `inferSchema`) ensure consistent types at scale

In a Databricks environment, the ETL and analytics notebooks would run as **scheduled jobs** against Delta tables, with the LLM layer triggered on completion.

---

## Production Considerations

- **Auditability** — validation errors are logged to a separate output file, not silently dropped
- **Reproducibility** — all transformations are deterministic and documented
- **Data quality** — anomalies (e.g. denied claims with paid amount > 0) are flagged and reported rather than corrected silently
- **Version control** — all code is Git-versioned following collaborative workflow practices
